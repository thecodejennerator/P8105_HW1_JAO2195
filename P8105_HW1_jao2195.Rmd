# Problem 1.1 - Install Packages / Load Libraries

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

Use the code below to download the a package containing the early_january_weather dataset:

install.packages("moderndive").

You only need to run this command once to install the package, and you can do so directly in the console. This code shouldnâ€™t be executed by your RMarkdown file.

Load the moderndive library, and use the following code to load the early_january_weather dataset:

```{r, message=FALSE}
#1. Installing Packages and Libraries 

#
#Loading Libraries
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#2. Loading early_january_weather dataset from moderndive package.

data(early_january_weather)

#3. Looking at help function to learn more about the variables in the dataset. 
help(early_january_weather)

```
# Problem 1.2 - Inline R code Dataset Discussion Short Description

Write a short description of the dataset using inline R code accessing the dataset help file can be informative. In your discussion, please include:

*the variables in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
*the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
*the mean temperature

# My Short Description of Early January Weather Dataset

The Early January Weather data (early_january_weather) is a dataset that contains hourly meterological data for Laguardia (LGA), John F. Kennedy (JFK) N, and Newark (EWR) Airports in the New York City area. This data is a subset of the nycflights13 dataset in R.  This dataset contains `r ncol(early_january_weather)` variables: `r colnames(early_january_weather)` and `r nrow(early_january_weather)` observations. Values of importat variables in the dataset include: Average Preciptation, which was `r mean(pull(early_january_weather, precip))` inches. Maximum visibility in early January was `r max(pull(early_january_weather,visib))` miles. The mean (average) temperature in early January 2013 was `r round(mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp)))` degrees Fahrenheit !

# Problem 1.3 - Creating Scatterplot of Humidity/Temperature Over Time

Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using the humid variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help). Describe patterns that are apparent in this plot.
Export your scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

# My Short Description of the Scatterplot 


```{r}
#Creating Scatterplot, storing in myplot object.
myplot <-
  ggplot(early_january_weather) + 
  geom_point(aes(x= time_hour, y = temp, col= humid)) + 
  labs(x="Time", y="Temperature (Fahrenheit, F)", col="Relative Humidity", title="Temperature vs. Humidity ") 

#Printing myplot object to rendered document.
myplot

#Saving .png file version to plot to working directory (wd).
ggsave("Temp_Humid_Scatterplot_Problem 1.png") 

```
