# Problem 1

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of `r ggplot` for variables of different types.

Use the code below to download the a package containing the `r penguins` dataset:

`r install.packages("moderndive")`

You only need to run this command once to install the package, and you can do so directly in the console. This code shouldnâ€™t be executed by your RMarkdown file.

Load the `r moderndive` library, and use the following code to load the early_january_weather dataset:

```{r}
#1. Installing Packages and Libraries 
#install.packages("moderndive")  #Commented out install so it does not execute in github rendering.
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)

#2. Loading early_january_weather dataset from moderndive package. Storing in variable called weather.

weather <- data("early_january_weather")

```

Write a short description of the dataset using inline R code; accessing the dataset help file can be informative. In your discussion, please include:

the variables in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
the mean temperature
Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using the humid variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help). Describe patterns that are apparent in this plot.

Export your scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

```{r}

```


```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
